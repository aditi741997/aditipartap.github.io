So after my internship at MSR ended this summer, I planned a trip to New York to chill and meet some of my friends. 

day1: walking around columbia : so small as compared to UIUC and stanford, lots of new students. walked in ? park, started raining, damn!!! went under a bridge, where i got talking to a music teacher, ... for more than an hour.
then decided to just walk in the rain - along the hudson : and barefoot!! was really fun lol.
then reached central park (put my shoes back on lol), while walking around ? pond, i saw not only a rainbow, but a sea turtle chilling in the pond : this just made my day!
 
day2: Williamsburg
Went to sunday in brooklyn, 
Met a girl (her 3rd sat there, ordered the same thing as me hehe), was from cali, the bartender was micaela, cute and nice, turns out she's an actor & singer! Then another guy who had his bday yesterday. They were all from florida lol.
It was just so nice chatting with random folks, eating amazing food.
Bartender ka last week hi breakup hua tha maine usko bola she's cute and good luck for her career, khush ho gyi aur :D
Got to know a lot about florida lol
Free shot bhi mila cuz bande ka bday tha lol
Bartending conventions hoti hain!
chilled in domino park, really nice.
Classon lexington citibike pains lol
Bbg : pretty! Wedding 
Prospect park boathouse : wedding, party
Subway to coney : ladies chat, aunty with many kids/adopted, married at 17,.... Got so excited when i told her i was going for a phd! (she was like i wish my 17yo soon was here awww) the other aunty too!  Chat about cali (she had lived there before) 
Coney island is apparently not very safe.... But the beach was nice! Got sorbet, charged my phone
Read all the way back : 1hr lol

day3: bookstore: [pics] love poems/strange world, went to little italy : i'll be honest, the cannolis weren't half as good as the ones from mike's pastry in boston. maybe i wasnt at the right place :p then biked to the ferry terminal - went to governers island : watched a play [about global warming : and what the world could look like when it gets out of hand], walked aorund, found a slide park : bringing back fond memories frm childhood, more walking around : really good views of the city!
