In 2018, While I was working as a software engineer at Microsoft in Vancouver, I got time to find what I like to do besides work (or CS in general). I heard about YMCA, which turned out to be very close to my apartment. There were lots of group classes there - like yoga, HIT, zumba, etc. ....
more stretchable over time :p , brings control yor body, a sense of routine, 

Then I moved to UIUC - continued going for zumba, but then COVID happened - and it all stopped. 

Now when I moved to Stanford, and as life has started going back to normal, I looked for such group classes here. And, as expected, found them here too! In my second week, I finally got time to go to a yoga class - and, it really was amazing. I felt so good, both physically and mentally, to be in the yoga studio with everyone else, listening to the calming music. just feels divine? . it made me remember how much i had always liked yoga - i am so grateful that its physical - remote is not the same : you go through the transitions, and oh you begin to lose balance - but many others are losing it too :p ... am definitely gonna practice yoga regularly now, or at least until COVID doesn't strike back :p

<!-- Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
