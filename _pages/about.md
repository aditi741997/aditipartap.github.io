I am a first year CS Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where I will be working with [Prof. Sachin Katti](https://web.stanford.edu/~skatti/).

Prior to joining Stanford, I completed my Masters in May 2021 from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where I was advised by [Prof. Radhika Mittal](http://radhikam.web.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I interned at Microsoft Research in the summer of 2021 with the [RFI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/) group, where I worked with [Ranveer Chandra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ranveer/) and [Anirudh Badam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/anbadam/) on leveraging AI to improve agricultural crop production. 

A little more history - I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2018 where I worked with [Prof. Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/) and [Prof. Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) on large scale question answering using tourism data. I pursued an internship with [Prof. Dina Katabi](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/dina-katabi) in the summer of 2018, during which I worked on enhancing reliability of [Emerald](https://www.emeraldinno.com/), a globally distributed IoT system. I also worked as a software engineer in the [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) team at Microsoft Vancouver before joining UIUC.

Apart from work, I enjoy cooking and travelling, and also like to do yoga, zumba and occassionally play badminton and read books.
